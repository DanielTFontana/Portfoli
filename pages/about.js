                Hi, i'm Daniel. I made this page to indroduce myself. I'm 30, geographer by formation,
                but i decided to change area and study programing. I've been studying languages such as javascript, html,
                css and react. My goal is to become a front-end programer with react as my main language. At the moment,
                i'm trying to find an internship to face new challenges and to grow as a professional.
                At the nav menu i've gathered some projects that i've already made.
